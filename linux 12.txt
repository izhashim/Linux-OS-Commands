There are a countless number of commands in Linux. We are bound to use a number of them on a daily routine or numerous times to perform common tasks than others. It is important to note that certain commands are “distro-based” – they can only be found in specific distros. While others are generic Unix/Linux commands that you’ll find in all if not most mainstream distros.

In this article, we will introduce you a list of most frequently used Linux commands with their examples for easy learning. You can find the actual description of each Linux command in their manual page which you can access like this:

$ man command-name
adduser/addgroup Command
The adduser and addgroup commands are used to add a user and group to the system respectively according to the default configuration specified in /etc/adduser.conf file.

$ sudo adduser tecmint

agetty Command
agetty is a program which manages physical or virtual terminals and is invoked by init. Once it detects a connection, it opens a tty port, asks for a user’s login name and calls up the /bin/login command. Agetty is a substitute of Linux getty:

$ agetty -L 9600 ttyS1 vt100
alias Command
alias is a useful shell built-in command for creating aliases (shortcut) to a Linux command on a system. It is helpful for creating new/custom commands from existing Shell/Linux commands (including options):

$ alias home='cd /home/tecmint/public_html'
The above command will create an alias called home for /home/tecmint/public_html directory, so whenever you type home in the terminal prompt, it will put you in the /home/tecmint/public_html directory.

anacron Command
anacron is a Linux facility used to run commands periodically with a frequency defined in days, weeks and months.

Unlike its sister cron; it assumes that a system will not run continuously, therefore if a scheduled job is due when the system is off, it’s run once the machine is powered on.

Okay, let’s say for a second someone has made themselves admin WITHOUT MY PERMISSION… Can I remove them using Linux?

Gosh I hope so. This is a simplistic solution and doesn’t consider the actual situation that you may be in:

$ sudo userdel user
$ sudo pkill -u user
Of course you’ll want to figure out how they got admin without your permission (sudo config, shared password, etc.)

Of course you can. As long as you belong to the superuser groups. You need to use the *userdel* command to delete a user account and related files from user account under Linux.

The *userdel* is the way to do it on the command line.

# userdel* username      (remove that user)
# userdel -r* username    (delete the user’s home directory and mail spool)
